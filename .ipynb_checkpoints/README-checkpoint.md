WeatherPy:

Discussion about the linear relationship: The linear regression on the Northern Hemisphere for "Latitude vs Max Temp" shows a moderate negative correlation at -0.62. The linear regression on the Southern Hemisphere for "Latitude vs Max Temp" shows a strong correlation at 0.75.

Discussion about the linear relationship: The linear regression for "Latitude vs Humidity" on both the northern and southern hemispheres show almost no correlation. The northern hemisphere shows -0.09 correlation and the southern hemisphere shows -0.08 correlation.

Discussion about the linear relationship: The linear regression for "Latitude vs Cloudiness" on both the northern and southern hemispheres show almost no correlation. The northern hemisphere shows -0.07 correlation and the southern hemisphere shows -0.14 correlation.

Discussion about the linear relationship: The linear regression for "Latitude vs Wind Speed" on both the northern and southern hemispheres show almost no correlation. The northern hemisphere shows -0.09 correlation and the southern hemisphere shows -0.12 correlation.


VacationPy:

I created a map for every city that was generated in the "WeatherPy" assignment. I then narrowed down the DataFrame to match my ideal weather conditions. I then used Geoapify API to find the first hotel within 10,000 meters of the coordinates. And finally, I created a new map to display the hotels in the cities with my ideal weather conditions.

As a side note, Yellowknife did not have any hotels within 10,000 meters of the coordinates, which is disappointing. This would have been my top choice for a vacation among the cities provided, as you can see the "Northern Lights" there.
